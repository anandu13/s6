Core Concepts & Protocols

1.1 Differentiate between TCP and UDP.

TCP: Connection-oriented (sets up connection), reliable (error checking, retransmission, acknowledgements, flow control), slower, stream-oriented.

UDP: Connectionless, unreliable (no error checking beyond optional checksum, no retransmission, no ACKs, no flow control), faster, packet-oriented. Both are bidirectional.
